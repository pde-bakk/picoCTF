# Basic_File_Exploit

After scanning through the source code, I saw

```c
if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
		puts(flag);
		fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
		exit(0);
	}
```
inside the data_read() function, so I wanted to trigger that, but when I tried to echo 0, it wouldn't work as I first needed to input some data into the database so I did that.

I entered the first integers that came to mind when it prompted me for them, returned to the echoing and voila, there is the flag.

```shell
nc saturn.picoctf.net 52681 
Hi, welcome to my echo chamber!
