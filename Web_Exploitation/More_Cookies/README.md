# More_Cookies

This one was difficult.

We can decode the cookie, and see another base64 encoded string. If we again decode that string, we get some unreadable characters.
This string is encrypted and we don't know how.
One bit in this string denotes whether the cookie belongs to an admin, so bruteforcing toggling each bit, we eventually find the correct cookie to send.
