# Flag_Shop

You can overflow the total_cost when buying the first kind of flag.
Since the cost is calculated like `total_cost = 900*number_flags`, if `900 * number_flags` were to go over the MAX_INT, you get money back. Just keep doing this until you have enough money to buy the 1337 flag.

`YOUR FLAG IS: picoCTF{m0n3y_bag5_9c5fac9b}`
